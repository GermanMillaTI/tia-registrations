        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representative Action Waiver</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp; </span><strong>Independent Contractor and Company mutually agree that by agreeing to arbitrate, each waives its right to have any dispute or claim brought, heard or arbitrated as a representative action and that the arbitrator will not have any authority to arbitrate a representative action</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ("</span><strong>Representative Action Waiver</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">").</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Procedural Requirements</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp; The arbitration will be governed by the terms of this Section and, except as otherwise provided in this Section 10, by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMs Rules”).&nbsp; The arbitration will be heard by one arbitrator selected in accordance with the JAMs Rules.&nbsp; The arbitrator will apply the state or federal substantive law, as applicable.&nbsp; The arbitrator may issue orders (including subpoenas to third parties) allowing the parties to conduct discovery sufficient to allow each party to prepare that party’s claims and defenses, taking into consideration that arbitration is designed to be a speedy and efficient method for resolving disputes.&nbsp; The arbitrator may hear motions and will apply the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing such motions.&nbsp; Except as provided in the Class Action Waiver and Representative Action Waiver, the arbitrator may award only remedies that would otherwise be available in a court of law.&nbsp; The arbitrator’s decision or award will be in writing with findings of fact and conclusions of law and will be final and binding on the parties.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief as needed to protect such party’s rights.&nbsp;</span></p>
